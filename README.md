# Minesweeper_UE_EditorTool

Hi! This is an implementation for Minesweeper as an Editor Tool inside Unreal Engine

# Installation 

This project is a plugin for Unreal Engine, all you have to do is drop it in your project under Plugins Folder. The project was done in UE 5.6, so you might need to rebuild from source 

# Use of AI/LLMs 

For this project AI has been used to find functions in faster ways than looking up the Docs such as generating a Random Number

# Here are some screenshots
