# Minesweeper_UE_EditorTool

Hi! This is an implementation for Minesweeper as an Editor Tool inside Unreal Engine

# Installation 

This project is a plugin for Unreal Engine, all you have to do is create a new folder under Plugins and Drop it in there. The project was done in UE 5.6, so you might need to rebuild from source 

# Use of AI/LLMs 

For this project AI has been used to find functions in faster ways than looking up the Docs such as generating a Random Number
